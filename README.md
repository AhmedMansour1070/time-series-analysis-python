# Time Series Analysis with Python
This repository explores the field of time series analysis using Python. It features techniques, models, and insights for understanding and forecasting time series data.

Currently, the focus is on foundational concepts, data preprocessing, and introductory models, with plans to expand as new techniques and models are explored.

🚀 Overview
This project aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for time series analysis, covering topics such as:

Preprocessing and handling time series data (missing values, indexing by dates, transformations).
Understanding key properties of time series: trend, seasonality, stationarity, and random noise.
Testing for stationarity using statistical methods like the Dickey-Fuller Test.
Decomposing time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
Differentiating between additive and multiplicative models for seasonality.
Introducing forecasting techniques like ARIMA, SARIMA, and more (coming soon!).
